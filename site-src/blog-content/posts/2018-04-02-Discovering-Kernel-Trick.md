title: Discovering the Kernel Trick
---

In this post, I'll explain the motivation of the kernel trick using a minimal example.

### Introduction
Although the kernel trick can be applied to a variety of pattern recognition algorithms, known collectively as kernel methods, our focus will be on applying the kernel trick in the context of a classification problem utilizing a simple linear classifier.

### Motivating Example: Classifying

### Problem: Real world data is not linearly separable

### Extensions

* Lower the number of true joint samples we provide to the model during training, this would certainly increase the time taken to converge, but it would show off the main advantage of the model - that it can learn the joint distribution with a few paired samples.
