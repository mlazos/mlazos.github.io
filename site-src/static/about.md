## About

I am a research software engineer on the Catapult team at Microsoft Research. My current work focuses on prototyping models to run on FPGAs and compilation tools targeting FPGAs. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing the piano, going for runs in the outdoors, playing soccer and skiing. I graduated from Brown University in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering with Honors. I enjoy meeting new people so if you'd like to reach out to talk about tech, careers, Seattle or just about anything else, my contact info is below.

My email is m[last name]922[at]gmail.com
