## Projects

***

#### [Server Optimization](https://www.google.com/patents/US9734036)

This was a project I worked on during an internship at IBM. We implemented a genetic algorithm to optimize apache server configurations.

***

#### [Triangle GAN](https://github.com/mlazos/triangle-gan-tf)

This is a toy problem I implemented to gain a better understanding of current topics in adversarial learning.

***

#### [RubyCore](https://github.com/mlazos/RubyCore)

This is an implementation of a small core language that models some aspects of control flow in Ruby.

***

#### [Honors Thesis](/resources/Automatic_Pixel_Classification_for_Indoor_Navigation.pdf)

This is an implementation of a custom model that consists of an SVM paired with an HMM to identify navigable terrain for a small robot indoors using only a monocular image. ([code](https://github.com/mlazos/HonorsThesis))
