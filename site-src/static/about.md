## About

I am a software engineer at Microsoft on the Exchange Inference team where I work on building machine learning features for email, protoytping models on FPGAs, and infrastructure to train and run these models in low-latency scenarios. My technical interests are machine learning and programming language design. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing the piano, going for runs in the outdoors, and skiing. I graduated from Brown University in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with Honors. I enjoy meeting new people so if you'd like to reach out to talk about tech, careers, Seattle or just about anything else, my contact info is below.

My email is m[last name]922[at]gmail.com
