## Projects

***

#### [Server Optimization](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9734036B2/)
This was a project I worked on during an internship at IBM. We implemented a genetic algorithm to optimize apache server configurations, and were granted multiple patents [[1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9734036B2/)][[2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9852043B2/)] for this system.

#### [Triangle GAN](https://mlazos.github.io/posts/2017-12-28-Joint-Distribution-Matching-Triangle-Gan.html)

This is a toy problem I implemented to gain a better understanding of current topics in adversarial learning. [[code](https://github.com/mlazos/triangle-gan-tf)]

***

#### [Honors Thesis](/resources/HonorsThesis.pdf)

This is an implementation of a custom model that consists of an SVM paired with an HMM to identify navigable terrain for a small robot indoors using only a monocular image. [[code](https://github.com/mlazos/HonorsThesis)]

***

#### [Kinematics, Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees](https://github.com/mlazos/cs1480)

This is an implementation of forward/inverse kinematics, and path finding with rapidly-exploring random trees. This is simulated using a javascript robotics simulator.

***

#### [RubyCore](https://github.com/mlazos/RubyCore)

This is an implementation of a small core language that models some aspects of control flow in Ruby.
